rails-ajax-example
==================

This is a quick prototype written to support a CodeMentor client.

The widgets form require behaviour whereby a selection in one field affects the options available in a field further down the form.

The commits in the master branch track the refactoring of a form from an html-only implementation to a basic AJAX-enhanced version with UJS and progressive enhancement.
